Stylesheets follow the Scalable and Modular Architecture for CSS philosophy.
SMACSS intends to improve your CSS organization, and can be reuse easily.

We divided our Stylesheets (it's not a problem because SASS/Grunt etc ... will compile
and minify a unique file for us at the end) in 5 sections :

-	Base (normalize)
-	Layout (margin, padding, width, height, display, visible ...)
-	State (visible, display, all that deserve a state ; strongly associated with JS event
	pseudo class, media queries.)
-	Module (style that belongs to a special components : slider, accordeon, widget)
-	Theme (background, color, font, and so on)
